# Android-SSH-SFTP-Client

The SSH-SFTP client-side system is a combination of the SSH (Secure Shell) and SFTP (Secure File Transfer) protocols combined into an Android application. The application will minimize the permissions required by other SSH-SFTP clients and reduce user-level complexity. The system will also provide simple SSH and SFTP interfaces for the user to use. One practical example of use case is to allow the transfer of select media wirelessly via SFTP when there is a lack of storage space on the mobile device the application is installed on. The application will provide a virtual console to the user if the user wishes to connect to a remote SSH hosting server. If the user decides to create an SFTP session, the application will create a simple file system interface allowing the user to select either the remote files to download or the local files to upload. The application will serve consumers who have a background in the Unix environment, to use the SSH client and navigate through both the remote and Androidâ€™s file system for the SFTP client. The remote servers will be hosted on a Unix environment but may include other environments for support. The key user needs include secure communications, reliability, performance, and supportability.
